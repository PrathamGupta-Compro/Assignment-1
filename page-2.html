            <p>Later, when Mary woke up again, the house was silent. Suddenly her door opened and two Englishmen came in.</p>
            <p> ‘Why has everyone forgotten me?’ she asked angrily. ‘Where’s my nanny? Where’s everyone?’</p>
            <p>‘Poor little girl,’ said one of the men. ‘There’s nobody here.’</p>
            <p>That’s how Mary discovered that her mother, her father and the
            servants were dead, because of a terrible disease. That was why the
            house was so silent. Now Marry Lennox was completely alone, so
            she was sent to England to live with her uncle, Mr Craven. He lived in a big house in Yorkshire called Misselthwaite Manor.
            </p>
            <p>Mrs Medlock, her uncle’s housekeeper, met Mary in London. As
            soon as Mary saw her, she didn’t like Mrs Medlock. But this was
            nothing new because Mary didn’t like anyone.
            </p>
            <p>Mrs Medlock didn’t like Mary, either. She thought that the little
            girl was bad-tempered and rude – and she was right. During the
            long train journey to Yorkshire, Mrs Medlock told Mary about the
            house where she was going to live. It seemed very large and dark,
            and it was near the moor.
            </p>
            <p>‘There’s nothing for you to do there, and your uncle isn’t
            interested in you,’ said Mrs Medlock. ‘He’s got a crooked back. He
            was an unpleasant young man until he got married. His wife was
            very pretty and he loved her very much. When she died, he became
            even stranger.’
            </p>
            <p>‘Oh, did she die?’ asked Mary.</p>
