                            ary Lennox was ten years old and she lived in India with her parents. Her father was always busy with his work and her mother was always busy with parties and friends. They didn’t have time for Mary, so an Indian nanny looked after her. <br>

                              The nanny allowed Mary to do anything she wanted because she didn’t want Mary to cry. So Mary became a spoilt, unpleasant girl with a bad temper. She was often ill and had a thin, sad face.

                              One hot morning Mary woke up and heard strange cries and shouts outside her door. But no one came to see her, so she went back to sleep.

                        Later, when Mary woke up again, the house was silent. Suddenly her door opened and two Englishmen came in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ‘Why has everyone forgotten me?’ she asked angrily. ‘Where’s my nanny? Where’s everyone?’
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ‘Poor little girl,’ said one of the men. ‘There’s nobody here.’
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That’s how Mary discovered that her mother, her father and the servants were dead, because of a terrible disease. That was why the  house was so silent. Now Marry Lennox was completely alone, so she was sent to England to live with her uncle, Mr Craven. He lived in a big house in Yorkshire called Misselthwaite Manor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mrs Medlock, her uncle’s housekeeper, met Mary in London. As soon as Mary saw her, she didn’t like Mrs Medlock. But this was nothing new because Mary didn’t like anyone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mrs Medlock didn’t like Mary, either. She thought that the little girl was bad-tempered and rude – and she was right. During the long train journey to Yorkshire, Mrs Medlock told Mary about the house where she was going to live. It seemed very large and dark, and it was near the moor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ‘There’s nothing for you to do there, and your uncle isn’t interested in you,’ said Mrs Medlock. ‘He’s got a crooked back. He was an unpleasant young man until he got married. His wife was very pretty and he loved her very much. When she died, he became even stranger.’
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ‘Oh, did she die?’ asked Mary
