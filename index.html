                ary Lennox was ten years old and she lived in India
                with her parents. Her father was always busy with his
                work and her mother was always busy with parties
                and friends. They didn’t have time for Mary, so an
                Indian nanny looked after her.
            </p>
            <p>
                The nanny allowed Mary to do anything she wanted because she
                didn’t want Mary to cry. So Mary became a spoilt, unpleasant girl
                with a bad temper. She was often ill and had a thin, sad face.
            </p>
            <p>
                One hot morning Mary woke up and heard strange cries and
                shouts outside her door. But no one came to see her, so she went
                back to sleep.
